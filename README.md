Tyler Menezes is the Executive Director at [CodeDay,](https://www.codeday.org/) where he works to provide welcoming and
diverse opportunities for under-served students to explore a future in tech and beyond.

Born in Canada but raised in the Pacific Northwest, he briefly attended the University of Washington before
dropping out to start a Y Combinator and venture-backed social video startup in 2011. This, combined with stints
working in machine learning at Microsoft Research and as a programmer at several Seattle startups, led to his work
finding data-driven solutions to increasing CS diversity and enrollment since 2014.

In his free time, Tyler organizes the public speaking event Ignite Seattle.
